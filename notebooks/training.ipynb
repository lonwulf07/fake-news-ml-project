It was a great moment!PRESIDENT TRUMP CLEARLY ENJOYED THE MOMENTARRIVAL IN JAPAN   FOCUS ON DEFENSE AND TRADEU.S. President Donald Trump ramped up his tough rhetoric against North Korea when he arrived in Japan on Sunday, saying that the United States and its allies are prepared to defend freedom and that  no dictator  should underestimate U.S. resolve. Trump kicked off a 12-day Asian trip and is looking to present a united front with Japan against North Korea through meetings with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe amid heightened tensions over Pyongyang s nuclear and missile tests.He told reporters on Air Force One en route to Asia that North Korea would figure prominently in discussions during the trip.It s clear that there s mutual admiration between the troops and President Trump. They know he s 100% behind them!Via: morung express\",\n          \"Sean Penn is not exactly one to mince words, and he didn t mince words when he was asked about the time he worked with Steve Bannon on a film project. Bannon has a heavy history of bankrolling and doing other work on films, even as recently as 2012. He was an executive producer for  The Indian Runner,  which was Penn s first time directing.Penn was not nice when talking about Bannon, and that s putting it mildly. He actually said: Bannon was then, as he is now, simply another bitter Hollywood wannabe who went rogue by way of toxic narcissistic iconoclasm. But, deep in his heart, he s just a conniving hateful bloated punk who despises mankind. And then there are also the bad things about him And then there are also the bad things about him  Wow. Just wow. We ve known since Bannon came into the spotlight a year ago that he was a complete dick who loves bullying people. Earlier this year, film critic Ann Hornaday wrote a piece for the Washington Post that talks about what we can learn about Bannon from watching the films he made.Many of his films are directly tied to his worldview   in fact, he s an extreme right-wing version of Michael Moore in that respect. He s spent a lot of time attacking  the permanent political class,  in his films, along with  hippies and community organizers  who allegedly hate this country and hate the Constitution. He s gone after Hillary Clinton and President Obama, but also Dick Cheney and George W. Bush. In short, he hates the whole world and everyone in it who doesn t see it exactly the way he does.Which seems to be exactly what Penn was describing in his mini-diatribe.Bannon is also someone who issues threats and ultimatums and strong-arms people into doing things his way. His narcissistic ego likely suffered a massive blow when he tried to bully Republicans on their farce of a healthcare bill by saying,  This is not a discussion. This is not a debate. You have no choice but to vote for this bill. Even before that sorry excuse of a bill failed, just the idea of Republicans not following his orders was enough for him to urge Trump to create a  shit list.  When Republicans scoffed in his general direction over his  orders,  it was very likely a humiliating defeat for him.So  he s just a conniving hateful bloated punk who despises mankind,  is a damned accurate description of him.Image of Sean Penn by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images for The Hollywood Reporter.

The words were posted beneath a photo of Williams, who is Black, posing together with her five-year-old daughter.The comment read: We ll see how much her life matters soon   better be careful leaving your info in the open where she can be found. Hold her close tonight, it ll be the last time. Williams, who lives in Texas, had never seen or spoken to the poster, identified on Facebook as Rodney Lee.She went to his Facebook page, and immediately saw pictures of a man wearing a police uniform. She contacted authorities immediately.The officer who left the message on her daughter s picture was identified as Rodney Lee Wilson. Until Sunday, Wilson was an officer working for the Overland Park Police Department, in Kansas.Williams says that Overland Park officials initially claimed Wilson s Facebook page was hacked.On Sunday, however, following an internal investigation, Oakland Park police acknowledged that Wilson did leave the threatening comments on Williams  photo.Overland Park Police Chief, Francis Donchez Jr, issued an official statement regarding the incident, on July 10.A post on the Overland Park Police Department s Facebook page reads: This morning, the Overland Park Police Department received notification about a Facebook post, reportedly made by one of our officers  from his personal Facebook account. I immediately initiated an investigation into the officer s actions and requested it be completed in a timely manner,  said Police Chief Francis Donchez Jr. During the investigation, by our Professional Standards Unit, we learned our officer did in fact make this post,  Donchez said.  It was obvious that our officer did not meet the standards of professionalism for the Overland Park Police Department. Overland Park has terminated the officer, effective immediately. The official post goes on to say: A criminal investigation is underway as a result of information discovered during the course of the personnel investigation. During an interview with Fox 4, Williams said she remains very fearful of the former-officer.  I don t know anything about this man,  she told reporters, stressing that she has no idea whether he will try to retaliate against her or her daughter.Watch the interview below from Fox 4 in Kansas.Image credit: video screen capture via Fox 4\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
